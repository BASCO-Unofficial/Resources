#### Linux Tips
##### ↳ Linux Terminal
[Kernel Man Pages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/)<br>
Documentation of the official Linux man-pages (manual pages). Man-pages cover detailed information on specific commands, typically covering their synopsis, description, and examples. Man-pages can also be accessed directly from the terminal using `man [command]`

[Linoxide - Linux Commands](https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-commands-brief-outline-examples/)<br>
Extensive list of over 90 Linux CLI commands with explanations. For a more compact version of the same commands, download Linoxide's [Linux Cheat Sheet][1]

1. https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/
  * This is an excellent way to start learning Linux command line and some of the quirks of the Linux terminal. I'd recommend only going as far into this game as you find useful. There is no reason to complete all thirty plus levels.  


##### ↳ Linux Networking
#### Windows Tips
[Windows SysInternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/)<br>
Expansive documentation of Windows' advanced system utilities and technical information

##### ↳ Windows Command Line
[Windows Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands)<br>
Official documentation of Windows-specific commands. Similar to Linux man-pages, this documentation covers detailed information typically covering their synopsis, description, and examples. This documentation can also be accessed directly from the terminal using `help [command]`
