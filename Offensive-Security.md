#### Exploitation
[LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)</br>
A collection of Microsoft-signed binaries and scripts that can be used by an attacker to advance their goal. These processes are drowned out in a sea of noise and make detection difficult from threat hunters.
#### Privilege Escalation

#### Reverse Engineering
[Malware Unicorn - Reverse Engineering 101](https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re101.html#11)</br>
A free course to introduce reverse-engineering of Windows malware. It topics ranging from environment setup to disassembly of machine code.

[Malware Unicorn - Reverse Engineering 102](https://malwareunicorn.org/workshops/re102.html#11)</br>
A free course to introduce reverse-engineering of Windows malware. A continuation of the 101 workshop, covering more advanced topics, such as: identifying and reversing encryption, and evasion techniques.

[Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/)</br>
