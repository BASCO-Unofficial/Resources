# Welcome to the BASCO Wiki!

Whether you are new to Information Security, a seasoned veteran, or anything in between, this Wiki is aimed at providing references to tools, utilities, and educational materials for all aspects of this field and Information Technology as a whole.

---

This Wiki is will contain FAQs; links to tutorials, tools, and utilities; and with other resources that students in the BASCO program have found useful.

While this Wiki will be a comprehensive collection of knowledge and experience from students in the program *one day*, understand that this project is still new. With only three contributors, populating these pages will be slow.

If you would like to help in developing this Wiki, please, request the `archivist` role in the BASCO Discord's `#role-request` room and reach out to us. Also, get a head start by reviewing how to [connect with GitHub](Github-SSH-Authentication).
